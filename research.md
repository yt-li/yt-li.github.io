### Brief Summary

**Yitong Li**`s current research includes power electronic converters, distribution power networks, and renewable energy systems. Detailed research areas include converter topologies, converter control, power network control, power and control theories, etc. He also has general interests in power train systems and chargers for electric vehicles, as well as advanced algorithms for smart grids.

### Highlights

* **Advanced ac-dc converters for bipolar dc distribution**

    The proposed three-phase ac-dc converter topologies can enable bidirectional power flow, and feed bipolar dc poles (i.e. three-wire dc system with positive, negative, and neutral lines) with potentially lower losses, less device costs, and a higher power density.

### Highlights

* **Advanced ac-dc converters for bipolar dc distribution.**

    The proposed ac-dc topologies enable bidirectional power flow and are able to feed bipolar dc poles (i.e. positive line, negative line, and neutral line) with potentially lower losses, less device costs, and a higher power density.

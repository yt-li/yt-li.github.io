## Research

<br />

### Summary

**Yitong Li**`s current research includes control techniques and power electronic converters for ac and dc distribution networks and power systems. Applications include medium- or low-voltage distribution grids, microgrids, distributed generations, sustainable and renewable energy systems, electric vehicles, etc. He also has general interests in advanced algorithms, control structures, and analysis tools for future low-carbon smart grids.

<br />

### Highlights

* **Power converter topologies**

    **PWM active rectifier with bipolar dc outputs:** a bidirectional three-phase ac-dc converter has six power switches, is able to feed bipolar dc outputs independently with a grounding inductor.

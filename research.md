## Research

<br />

### Brief Summary

**Yitong Li**`s current research includes power electronic converters for low- and medieum-voltage-level applications, such as distribution power networks, distributed generations, renewable energy systems, electric vehicles, etc. Detailed research areas include converter topologies, converter control, power network control, power and control theories, etc. He also has general interests in advanced algorithms and analysis tools for smart grids.

<br />

### Highlights

* **Power electronic converter topologies**

    PWM active rectifier + grounding inductor: a bidirectional three-phase ac-dc converter has only six power switches, but is able to feed bipolar dc outputs independently.

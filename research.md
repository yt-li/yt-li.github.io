## Research

<br />

### Brief Summary

**Yitong Li**`s current research includes control techniques and power electronic converters for medieum- and low-voltage-level power systems, such as distribution networks, microgrids, distributed generations, renewable energy systems, electric vehicles, etc. He also has general interests in advanced algorithms, control structures, and analysis tools for future low-carbon smart grids.

<br />

### Highlights

* **Power electronic converter topologies**

    **PWM active rectifier + grounding inductor:** a bidirectional three-phase ac-dc converter has only six power switches, but is able to feed bipolar dc outputs independently.
